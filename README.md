The project manages diverse financial portfolios for clients, constructed entirely using Structured Query Language (SQL)
/
The database [financial_portfolio] comprises four tables:

1. Clients - containing basic client information such as names and contact details.
2. Investments - recording initial investment amounts, investment dates, and types of investments (e.g., fund types).
3. Portfolios - categorizing portfolio types.
4. Returns - tracking investment performance and return dates.

Table relationships are established using primary keys and foreign keys in MySQL.
